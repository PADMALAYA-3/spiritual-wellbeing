          Raise your hand if you’ve been personally victimized by the endless
          hustle of modern life. Between punishing work schedules, endless to-do
          lists, and the constant pings of technology and social media, it’s a
          miracle any of us have secured even a moment’s peace and downtime
          lately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our minds are frazzled, our souls fried to a crisp as we mindlessly
          careen from obligation to obligation. We’re living in a spiritual and
          emotional drought, disconnected from our deepest selves as the dull
          roar of anxiety and restlessness intensifies. Can you relate? I sure
          as hell can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not long ago, I was speeding through my days in a total foggy haze,
          numbing out to drown the bubbling stress and constantly nipping at my
          heels. Life became an endless checklist to bulldoze through rather
          than something to actually experience and savor.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was sick of feeling endlessly frantic and behind, starving for
          moments of peace yet struggling to stay rooted in the present. My mind
          and body were stuck in a chronic state of agitation, constantly
          anticipating the future or rehashing the past. And let me tell you,
          that “monkey mind” is utterly exhausting.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was during one particularly intense stretching of burning the
          candle at both ends that something inside of me finally snapped. I was
          edgy, anxious, and emotionally fried from overgiving, overscheduling,
          and constantly abandoning my own needs. I felt like a shell, stretched
          thin across a million priorities with no internal nourishment.
