        Raise your hand if you’ve been personally victimized by the endless
        hustle of modern life. Between punishing work schedules, endless to-do
        lists, and the constant pings of technology and social media, it’s a
        miracle any of us have secured even a moment’s peace and downtime
        lately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our minds are frazzled, our souls fried to a crisp as we mindlessly
        careen from obligation to obligation. We’re living in a spiritual and
        emotional drought, disconnected from our deepest selves as the dull roar
        of anxiety and restlessness intensifies. Can you relate? I sure as hell
        can.

      <p>
        Not long ago, I was speeding through my days in a total foggy haze,
        numbing out to drown the bubbling stress and constantly nipping at my
        heels. Life became an endless checklist to bulldoze through rather than
        something to actually experience and savor.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was sick of feeling endlessly frantic and behind, starving for moments
        of peace yet struggling to stay rooted in the present. My mind and body
        were stuck in a chronic state of agitation, constantly anticipating the
        future or rehashing the past. And let me tell you, that “monkey mind” is
        utterly exhausting.
